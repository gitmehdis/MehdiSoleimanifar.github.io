The first problem involves characterizing the properties of entanglement in the ground state of gapped local Hamiltonians, which is a central topic in quantum many-body physics. The second problem is on the quantum communication complexity of testing bipartite states with EPR assistance, a well-known question in quantum information theory. I will present a communication protocol for testing ground states and show how its communication complexity reveals a new structural property for the ground state entanglement, namely that gapped ground states possess limited entanglement spread across any cut, exhibiting an area law behavior. The entanglement spread is a measure of how spread out the Schmidt coefficients are across a bipartite cut in a given state.\nWhile most of the previous properties of gapped ground states are only established for 1D geometries, this construction applies to any interaction graph with an improved bound for the special case of lattices. On the technical side, our work uses recent advances in Hamiltonian simulation algorithms along with quantum phase estimation and quantum expanders to give a new construction for an approximate ground space projector (AGSP).

This talk will focus on the problem of estimating the partition function which has been the subject of various numerical and theoretical studies both in statistical physics and computer science. It is well known that this problem is computationally hard in the worst case. In this talk, I will present a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that estimates the partition function of quantum many-body systems above the phase transition point.\nThe algorithm extrapolates the solution at high temperatures where the problem is easy to low temperatures where finding the solution is harder. The running time of this algorithm relies on the locus of the complex zeros of the partition function. I will talk about cases where we can locate these complex zeros. I will also discuss the relation between other signatures of the phase transition such as the exponential decay of correlations and the locus of these zeros.\nThis is based on joint work with Aram Harrow and Saeed Mehraban https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09071.","tags":[],"title":"Counting without Sampling: Approximation Algorithms for Quantum Many-Body Systems at Finite Temperatures","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mehdi Soleimanifar","Vahid Karimipour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476921600,"objectID":"3de03db281f5ec265600cbc0e9e8d666","permalink":"https://MehdiSoleimanifar.github.io/publication/gates_iteration/","publishdate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gates_iteration/","section":"publication","summary":"[In Physical Review A](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012344)","tags":null,"title":"No-Go theorem for iterations of unknown quantum gates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Movahednasab","Mehdi Soleimanifar","Amin Gohari","Masoumeh N.
